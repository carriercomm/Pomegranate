Making Pomegranate is very easy :) You just should following the next steps:

1. Prepare the source code.

   You can download the latest code at [[http://github.com/macan/Pomegranate]]
   via web browser or git.

   git clone git://github.com/macan/Pomegranate.git

   or via HTTP downloading at the following URL,

   http://github.com/macan/Pomegranate/archives/master

2. Prepare the GCC tools.

   You should have gcc, make, and other binary utilities.

   Make sure you are compiling on a 64-bit box! For now, Pomegranate only
   supports 64-bit box.

3. Make the binary code.

   Note that, current code base do NOT support 32 bits platform, as a result,
   please do NOT try to make and run the binary code on a 32 bits box.

   $ make

4. We have already done:)

   All the binaries is in their own directories. For example, the MDS server,
   MDSL server, MKFS utility, unit test clients are in directory
   `test/xnet'. The Pomegranate libraries are in directory `lib/'. I described
   it more detailly in the following table.

   Pathname             Description

   test/xnet            MDS server:     mds.ut
                        MDSL server:    mdsl.ut
                        R2 server:      root.ut
                        MKFS utility:   r2cli.ut
                        UT client:      client.ut

   lib/                 API lib:        libapi.so.1.0
                        HVFS lib:       libhvfs.so.1.0
                        MDS lib:        libmds.so.1.0
                        MDSL lib:       libmdsl.so.1.0
                        XNET lib:       libxnet.so.1.0
                        R2 lib:         libr2.so.1.0
