Pomegranate TODOs:

1. Dynamically add and delete sites on active system (Priority: low)

   0. find the impacted site groups (root only)

   1. setup client request filter to block client requests (sync)

   2. bcast / receive the new ring (sync)

   3. flush the async queue of each impacted site (sync)

   4. snapshot each impacted site (sync)

   5. bcast / change the new ring to all (sync)

2. Distributed execution framework embeded in MDSL (Priority: low)

3. Active code with each table line (Priority: high)

4. Key/Value store support multiple columns (Priority: high)

   We planed to use e->column[0] to store the indirect columns. Any column id
   bigger than 5 will use this indirect column to address the correct
   column. Client needs to fetch the column 0 to parse the correct column
   info. The internal structure of the indirect column is a sorted list. We
   have provide a API to parse, add, delete columns. Enjoy it:)

   Scheduled from 10/15/2010 to 10/20/2010.

5. Add stat info about which hash ring range got max accesses.

   Is there a need to add vsite links for each ITB?
