1. HVFS architecture

   HVFS is divided into four parts: client, metadata server, metadata storage
   server, low level file systems.

   Client is the interface for POSIX access.

   Metadata server is the memory cached metadata service, supporting excellent
   scalability and metadata performance. 

   Metadata storage server is the stable storage service of the metadata.

   Low level file systems are the non-metadata storage service of the HVFS.

2. Directories

   include/ : common header files

   mds/ : metadata server

   mdsl/ : metadata storage layer

   kc/ : kernel-level client

   xnet/ : communication layer

   lib/ : library for ring and other things

   r/ : ring and root manager

   api/ : API for userspace direct access
